UCSF ohgami lab pdf nlp project
corinn.small@ucsf.edu

Natural language processing (NLP) pipeline for the blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (bpdcn) project. We want to streamline pdf analysis by using
the aws sdk 'textract' and pull out relevant disease data including patient history, tissue/cell morphology, cell markers (disease cell origin/type), genetics,
treatments and outcome. WE also want to eventually include images.
